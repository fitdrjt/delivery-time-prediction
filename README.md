# Smart ETA: Data-Driven Delivery Time Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts time taken to deliver food

## Overview
In a fast-paced food delivery market where timing is everything, unpredictable factors like traffic, weather, and vehicle conditions can derail efficiency and customer satisfaction. This project leverages machine learning to predict delivery time using real-world operational data, enabling smarter logistics, proactive planning, and optimized routes that reduce delays, improve customer experience, and lower operational costs.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning that predicts time taken to deliver products based on features such as, weather, traffic, vehicle, et cetera.
